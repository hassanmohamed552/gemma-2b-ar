## Arabic Writing Assistant Model
### Overview
This project provides a writing assistant model fine-tuned on the Gemma-2B dataset, which consists of a diverse range of Arabic articles. The model is designed to assist users in generating, editing, and enhancing Arabic text through an intuitive chat-based user interface (UI).

### Features
Fine-tuned Language Model: Built on the Gemma-2B dataset for high-quality Arabic language understanding and generation.
Chat UI: User-friendly interface for real-time interactions with the writing assistant.
Text Generation: Generate coherent and contextually relevant Arabic text.
Text Enhancement: Improve existing text with suggestions and edits.
Customization: Tailor responses based on user preferences and writing styles.
